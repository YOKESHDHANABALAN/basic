    <h1>Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 :</h1>
    
    <p>HTTP2 Vs. HTTP1 is not a debate at all. HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.</p>

    <p>HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster. However, an impressive increase in network bandwidth only slightly improves page load time. This is key to understanding the differences in performance efficiencies between the different versions of HTTP. Back in the day when people used dial up modems web pages were simple and it was the actual data transfer between the server and the client that contributed towards the largest chunk of the page load time. Today the actual downloading of resources from server takes a negligible portion of the total page load time due to the tremendous increase in bandwidth availability. It is the time taken to establish the TCP connection and making requests that impacts performance. It was initially recommended to use only two connections per hostname but today most browsers use six connections per hostname. When we talk about http vs http2 in terms of performance it is important to note that a lot of performance optimizations adopted by HTTP/1.1 introduced complexities in terms of developmental efforts as well as network congestion that HTTP/2 attempts to address.</p>
        
    <p>The table below points out the differentiating factors between http2 vs http1:</p>
        
    <p>Header CompressionHeaders are sent on every request leading to a lot of duplicate data being sent uncompressed across the wire.Header compression is included by default in HTTP/2 using HPACK.Performance OptimizationProvides support for caching to deliver pages faster.Spriting, concatenating, inlining, domain sharding are some of the optimizations used as a workaround to the ‘six connections per host’ rule.Removes the need for unnecessary optimization hacks.Protocol TypeText based protocol that is in the readable form.It is a binary protocol (HTTP requests are sent in the form of 0s and 1s). Needs to be converted back from binary in order to read it.SecuritySSL is not required but recommended. Digest authentication used in HTTP1.1 is an improvement over HTTP1.0. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS for secure encrypted communication.Though security is still not mandatory, it is mostly encrypted (though it is not enforced) since almost all clients require traffic to be encrypted. It also has some minimum standards, such as minimum key size for encryption. TLS 1.2 etc.</p>
